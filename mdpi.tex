\section{Introduction}
Partial differential equations (PDEs) are used to model many phenomena in science and engineering. Fluid mechanics and heat transfer are among these phenomena which can be notoriously difficult to solve on a pragmatic scale. Wildfire is a good example of an expensive numerical simulation because it involves fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and chemistry over massive areas of impact. Wildfire is also an unsteady phenomenon---so it changes over time. The ability to accurately model and predict the properties of such a phenomenon in real time would allow for better response to it, but, there are many challenges associated with making these predictions.

Unsteady multi-dimensional PDEs often require the use of distributed memory systems to obtain a solution with practical grid resolution or scale in a reasonable time frame. The solution of many problems at any point in the grid is inherently dependent on the neighboring points in each dimension. This dependence necessitates communication between computing nodes. Each of these communications incurs a minimum cost regardless of the amount of information communicated known as network latency. On the contrary, bandwidth is the variable cost associated with the amount of data transferred. The total latency cost can be significantly restrictive on the solution's time to completion, especially when using distributed systems. This barrier to scaling is referred to as the latency barrier and is impactful in large scale simulations advancing many time steps, i.e., ones that require a large amount of communication \cite{Alhubail2016ThePDEs}. The barrier is a bottle neck in the system which can limit the performance regardless of the architecture.

\par
Graphics processing units (GPUs) are powerful tools for scientific computing because they are well suited for parallel applications and large quantities of calculations. Modern computing clusters often have GPUs in addition to CPUs because of their potential to accelerate simulations and, similar to CPUs, they perform best when communication is minimized. These modern clusters are often referred to as heterogeneous systems or a system with multiple processor types---a system with CPUs and GPUs in this case. Ideally, a heterogeneous application will minimize communication between the GPU and CPU which effectively minimizes latency costs \cite{OanceaGPGPUCOMPUTING}. Minimizing latency in high performance computing (HPC) is one of the barriers to exascale computing which requires the implementation of novel techniques to improve \cite{Alexandrov2016RouteSkills}.

\par
\pysweep{}\footnote{\github} is our implementation of a two-dimensional heterogeneous solver for unsteady partial differential equations that employs a technique to help overcome the latency barrier---the swept rule \cite{Alhubail2016ThePDEs}. In other words, the swept rule is a latency reduction technique that focuses on obtaining a solution to unsteady PDEs at as many possible locations and times prior to communicating with other computing nodes (ranks). In this article, we first discuss related work, the distinctions between our work, and more motivation in section~\ref{related-section}. Next, we describe some implementation details, objectives, study parameters, design decisions, methods, and tests in section~\ref{methods-section}. As expected, this is followed with results and conclusions in sections~\ref{results-section} and~\ref{conclusions-section}. Finally, the paper closes with acknowledgements, references, and appendices.

\section{Materials and Methods}

Materials and Methods should be described with sufficient details to allow others to replicate and build on published results. Please note that publication of your manuscript implicates that you must make all materials, data, computer code, and protocols associated with the publication available to readers. Please disclose at the submission stage any restrictions on the availability of materials or information. New methods and protocols should be described in detail while well-established methods can be briefly described and appropriately cited.

Research manuscripts reporting large datasets that are deposited in a publicly avail-able database should specify where the data have been deposited and provide the relevant accession numbers. If the accession numbers have not yet been obtained at the time of submission, please state that they will be provided during review. They must be provided prior to publication.

Interventionary studies involving animals or humans, and other studies require ethical approval must list the authority that provided approval and the corresponding ethical approval code.

\section{Results}

This section may be divided by subheadings. It should provide a concise and precise description of the experimental results, their interpretation as well as the experimental conclusions that can be drawn.

\subsection{Figures, Tables and Schemes}

All figures and tables should be cited in the main text as Figure~\ref{fig1}, Table~\ref{tab1}, etc.

\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

This is the example 1 of equation:
\begin{equation}
a = 1,
\end{equation}
the text following an equation need not be a new paragraph. Please punctuate equations as regular text.
%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph.

This is the example 2 of equation:
\end{paracol}
\nointerlineskip
\begin{equation}
a = b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k + l + m + n + o + p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w + x + y + z
\end{equation}

% Example of a figure that spans the whole page width (the commands \widefigure and \begin{paracol}{2}, \linenumbers, and\switchcolumn need to be present). The same concept works for tables, too.
\begin{figure}[H]	
\widefigure
\includegraphics[width=15 cm]{Definitions/logo-mdpi}
\caption{This is a wide figure.\label{fig2}}
\end{figure}  
\begin{paracol}{2}
\linenumbers
\switchcolumn

Please punctuate equations as regular text. Theorem-type environments (including propositions, lemmas, corollaries etc.) can be formatted as follows:
%% Example of a theorem:
\begin{Theorem}
Example text of a theorem.
\end{Theorem}

The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:

%% Example of a proof:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem 1]
Text of the proof. Note that the phrase ``of Theorem 1'' is optional if it is clear which theorem is being referred to.
\end{proof}
The text continues here.

\section{Heat Diffusion Equation}
\label{Heat-Diffusion}
The heat diffusion problem is as follows:
\begin{align*}
    &\rho c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = k\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}+k\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2},\quad 0<x<1,\quad 0<y<1,\quad t>0\\
    &T(0,y,t) = T(1,y,t),\quad 0<x<1,\quad t>0\\
    &T(x,0,t) = T(x,1,t),\quad 0<y<1,\quad t>0\\
    &T(x,y,0) = sin(2\pi x)\,sin(2\pi y), \quad 0\leq x\leq 1,\quad 0 \leq y \leq 1
\end{align*}
with an analytical solution of
\begin{equation*}
\label{heat-analyt}
    T(x,y,t) = sin(2\pi x)\,sin(2\pi y)\,e^{-8\pi^2\alpha t}
\end{equation*}
and an update equation of 
\begin{equation*}
    \label{heat-update}
    T_{i,j}^{k+1} = T_{i,j}^{k}+\frac{\alpha \Delta t}{\Delta x^2}\big(T_{i+1,j}^{k}-2T_{i,j}^{k}+T_{i-1,j}^{k}\big)+\frac{\alpha \Delta t}{\Delta y^2}\big(T_{i,j+1}^{k}-2T_{i,j}^{k}+T_{i,j-1}^{k}\big)
\end{equation*}

\section{Compressible Euler Vortex}
\label{Compressible-Euler}
The compressible Euler equations and the equation of state use are as follows where subscripts represent derivatives with respect to the spatial dimensions (x and y) or time (t).
\begin{align*}
    &\rho_t  = (\rho u)_x + (\rho v)_y \\ 
    &(\rho u)_t  = (\rho u+P)_x + (\rho u v)_y\\
    &(\rho v)_t  = (\rho v+P)_y + (\rho u v)_x\\
    &E_t = ((E+P)u)_x+((E+P)v)_y\\
    &E = \frac{P}{\gamma -1}+\frac{1}{2}\rho(u^2+v^2)
\end{align*}
Similar to the heat diffusion equation, periodic boundary conditions were implemented but only one boundary condition is required in each direction because the order of the derivative. However, the numerical scheme is much more complicated.
