Pressurized high and low temperature pure waters were alternately supplied to an autoclave containing a thin-walled cylindrical specimen. The fatigue specimen was then subjected to homogeneous thermal stress through the wall thickness. The thermal fatigue strengths were compared with the mechanical fatigue strength performed in air and in high temperature water. It was found that the thermal fatigue strength of type 304 stainless steels almost agreed with the mechanical fatigue strength when the nominal stress amplitude was converted to a fictitious stress amplitude by using the mean value of strain amplitudes for room temperature and 288°C.},

	abstract = {Welding is a reliable and efficient metal-joining process widely used in industry. Due to the intense concentration of heat in the heat source of welding, the regions near the weld line undergo severe thermal cycles, thereby generating inhomogeneous plastic deformation and residual stresses in the weldment. Plates of different thickness are used in industry and these plates are normally joined by multipass welding. In a multipass welding operation, the residual stress pattern developed in the material changes with each weld pass. In the present experimental work, thermal cycles and transverse residual stresses due to each pass of welding have been measured in the weld pads of AISI type 304 stainless steel and low carbon steel with 6, 8 and 12mm thickness. X-ray diffraction method was used for residual stress measurements. The welding process used was the Manual Metal Arc Welding (MMAW) process. In this paper, the peak temperatures attained at different points during deposition of weld beads in stainless steel and low carbon steel weld pads are compared. The residual stress patterns developed, the change in the peak tensile stress with the deposition of weld beads, and the relation between the peak temperatures and the residual stresses in the weld pads are discussed.},

Among the different strategies and technologies available to mitigate the effects of fire, wildfire behavior prediction may be a promising strategy. This approach allows for the identification of areas at greatest risk of being burned, thereby permitting to make decisions which in turn will help to reduce losses and damages. In this work we present an Evolutionary-Statistical System with Island Model, a new approach of the uncertainty reduction method Evolutionary-Statistical System. The operation of ESS is based on statistical analysis, parallel computing and Parallel Evolutionary Algorithms (PEA). ESS-IM empowers and broadens the search process and space by incorporating the Island Model in the metaheuristic stage (PEA), which increases the level of parallelism and, in fact, it permits to improve the quality of predictions.},

	abstract = {In a new effort to make our research transparent and reproducible by others, we developed a workflow to run and share computational studies on the public cloud Microsoft Azure. It uses Docker containers to create an image of the application software stack. We also adopt several tools that facilitate creating and managing virtual machines on compute nodes and submitting jobs to these nodes. The configuration files for these tools are part of an expanded "reproducibility package" that includes workflow definitions for cloud computing, in addition to input files and instructions. This facilitates recreating the cloud environment to rerun the computations under the same conditions. Although cloud providers have improved their offerings, many researchers using high-performance computing (HPC) are still skeptical about cloud computing. Thus, we ran benchmarks for tightly coupled applications to confirm that the latest HPC nodes of Microsoft Azure are indeed a viable alternative to traditional on-site HPC clusters. We also show that cloud offerings are now adequate to complete computational fluid dynamics studies with in-house research software that uses parallel computing with GPUs. Finally, we share with the community what we have learned from nearly two years of using Azure cloud to enhance transparency and reproducibility in our computational simulations.},

	abstract = {Models that simulate wildland fires span a vast range of complexity; the most physically complex present a difficult supercomputing challenge that cannot be solved fast enough to become a forecasting tool. Coupled atmosphere–fire model simulations of the Big Elk Fire, a wildfire that occurred in the Colorado Front Range during 2002, are used to explore whether some factors that make simulations more computationally demanding (such as coupling between the fire and the atmosphere and fine atmospheric model resolution) are needed to capture wildland fire parameters of interest such as fire perimeter growth. In addition to a Control simulation, other simulations remove the feedback to the atmospheric dynamics and use increasingly coarse atmospheric resolution, including some that can be computed in faster than real time on a single processor. These simulations show that, although the feedback between the fire and atmosphere must be included to capture accurately the shape of the fire, the simulations with relatively coarse atmospheric resolution (grid spacing 100–500 m) can qualitatively capture fire growth and behavior such as surface and crown fire spread and smoke transport. A comparison of the computational performance of the model configured at these different spatial resolutions shows that these can be performed faster than real time on a single computer processor. Thus, although this model still requires rigorous testing over a wide range of fire incidents, it is computationally possible to use models that can capture more complex fire behavior (such as rapid changes in intensity, large fire whirls, and interactions between fire, weather, and topography) than those used currently in the field and meet a faster-than-real-time operational constraint.},

Methods to reduce structure losses are focussed on fuel treatments in either wildland fuels or residential fuels. There is a need for a well-characterised, systematic testing of these approaches across a range of community and structure types and fire conditions. Laboratory experiments, field measurements and fire behaviour models can be used to better determine the exposure conditions faced by communities and structures. The outcome of such an effort would be proven fuel treatment techniques for wildland and residential fuels, risk assessment strategies, economic cost analysis models, and test methods with representative exposure conditions for fire-resistant building designs and materials.},

	abstract = {Fires spreading in elevated vegetation, such as chaparral or pine forest canopies, are often more intense than fires spreading through surface vegetation such as grasslands. As a result, they are more difficult to suppress, produce higher heat fluxes, more firebrands and smoke, and can interact with, or create, local weather conditions that lead to dangerous fire behavior. Such wildland fires can pose a serious threat to wildland–urban interface communities. A basic building block of such fires is a single tree. In the work presented here, a number of individual trees, of various characteristics, were burned without an imposed wind in the Large Fire Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards of Technology. A numerical model capable of representing the spatial distribution of vegetation in a tree crown is presented and evaluated against tree burning experiments. For simplicity, the vegetation was assumed to be uniformly distributed in a tree crown represented by a well defined geometric shape (cone or cylinder). Predictions of the time histories of the radiant heat flux and mass loss rates for different fuel moisture contents and tree heights compared favorably to measured values and trends. This work is a first step toward the development and application of a physics-based computer model to spatially complex, elevated, vegetation present in forest stands and in the wildland–urban interface.},

	abstract = {Physics-based coupled fire–atmosphere models are based on approximations to the governing equations of fluid dynamics, combustion, and the thermal degradation of solid fuel. They require significantly more computational resources than the most commonly used fire spread models, which are semi-empirical or empirical. However, there are a number of fire behaviour problems, of increasing relevance, that are outside the scope of empirical and semi-empirical models. Examples are wildland–urban interface fires, assessing how well fuel treatments work to reduce the intensity of wildland fires, and investigating the mechanisms and conditions underlying blow-up fires and fire spread through heterogeneous fuels. These problems are not amenable to repeatable full-scale field studies. Suitably validated coupled atmosphere–fire models are one way to address these problems. This paper describes the development of a three-dimensional, fully transient, physics-based computer simulation approach for modelling fire spread through surface fuels. Grassland fires were simulated and compared to findings from Australian experiments. Predictions of the head fire spread rate for a range of ambient wind speeds and ignition line-fire lengths compared favourably to experiments. In addition, two specific experimental cases were simulated in order to evaluate how well the model predicts the development of the entire fire perimeter.},

	abstract = {We explore the basis of understanding wildland fire behaviour with the intention of stimulating curiosity and promoting fundamental investigations of fire spread problems that persist even in the presence of tremendous modelling advances. Internationally, many fire models have been developed based on a variety of assumptions and expressions for the fundamental heat transfer and combustion processes. The diversity of these assumptions raises the question as to whether the absence of a sound and coherent fire spread theory is partly responsible. We explore the thesis that, without a common understanding of what processes occur and how they occur, model reliability cannot be confirmed. A theory is defined as a collection of logically connected hypotheses that provide a coherent explanation of some aspect of reality. Models implement theory for a particular purpose, including hypotheses of phenomena and practical uses, such as prediction. We emphasise the need for theory and demonstrate the difference between theory and modelling. Increasingly sophisticated fire management requires modelling capabilities well beyond the fundamental basis of current models. These capabilities can only be met with fundamental fire behaviour research. Furthermore, possibilities as well as limitations for modelling may not be known or knowable without first having the theory.},
