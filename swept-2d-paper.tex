\section{Introduction}

Unsteady multidimensional PDES often require the use of shared and/or distributed memory systems to obtain a solution with practical grid resolution or scale in a reasonable time frame. The solution of many problems at any point in the grid is ineherently dependent on the neighboring points in each dimension. This dependence necessitates communication between computing nodes. Each of these communications incurs a minimum cost regardless of the amount of information communicated known as network latency.  This latency can be siginificantly restrictive on the solution's time to completion, especially when using distributed systems. This barrier to scaling is referred to as the latency barrier and is particularly impactful in solutions advancing many time steps [CITE ALHUBAIL AND WANG]. 

you can do something like:
1. solving multidimensional PDEs for practical problems requires using shared and/or distributed memory systems
2.  bandwidth and latency between processing units, particularly in distributed systems, can be a bottleneck. separately (but related), when you have things like GPUs, you want to do as much local work as possible before communicating between the independent processors
3. how have others tried to solve this?
4. what past work has been done specifically on the swept approach?
5. what are the objectives of this study?


\paragraph{Usage} Once the package is properly installed, you can use the document class \emph{elsarticle} to create a manuscript. Please make sure that your manuscript follows the guidelines in the Guide for Authors of the relevant journal. It is not necessary to typeset your manuscript in exactly the same way as an article, unless you are submitting to a camera-ready copy (CRC) journal.

\paragraph{Functionality} The Elsevier article class is based on the standard article class and supports almost all of the functionality of that class. In addition, it features commands and options to format the
\begin{itemize}
\item document style
\item baselineskip
\item front matter
\item keywords and MSC codes
\item theorems, definitions and proofs
\item lables of enumerations
\item citation style and labeling.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methods}

The author names and affiliations could be formatted in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item Group the authors per affiliation.
\item Use footnotes to indicate the affiliations.
\end{enumerate}
See the front matter of this document for examples. You are recommended to conform your choice to the journal you are submitting to.

\section{Theory}

There are various bibliography styles available. You can select the style of your choice in the preamble of this document. These styles are Elsevier styles based on standard styles like Harvard and Vancouver. Please use Bib\TeX\ to generate your bibliography and include DOIs whenever available.

Here are two sample references: \cite{Feynman1963118,Dirac1953888}.
